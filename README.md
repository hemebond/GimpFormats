# GimpFormats

<img src="readme-assets/icons/name.png" alt="Project Icon" width="750">

Forked from https://github.com/TheHeadlessSourceMan/gimpFormats

A pure python implementation of the GIMP XCF image format. Use this to interact
with GIMP image formats

Issues and contributions very much wanted/ needed :smile:

Previously under `gimpformats_unofficial` now under `gimpformats`

## Getting started

Read an image
```python
from gimpformats.gimpXcfDocument import GimpDocument
project = GimpDocument("image.xcf")
```

Iterate the image and report the contents of each group followed by the first
level children of the image
```python
"""List data on groups followed by the direct children of a gimp xcf document
"""
layers = project.layers
index = 0
print("## Group info...")
while index < len(layers):
	layerOrGroup = layers[index]
	if layerOrGroup.isGroup:
		index += 1
		while layers[index].itemPath is not None:
			print("Group \"" + layerOrGroup.name + "\" contains Layer \"" + layers[index].name + "\"")
			layers.pop(index)
	else:
		index += 1

print("## Document direct children...")
for layerOrGroup in layers:
	print("\"" + layerOrGroup.name + "\" is a " + ("Group" if layerOrGroup.isGroup else "Layer"))

```

Example output:

```none
## Group info...
Group "Layer Group" contains Layer "Layer"
Group "Layer Group" contains Layer "Layer2"
## Document direct children...
"bg #1" is a Layer
"bg" is a Layer
"bg #2" is a Layer
"Transformation" is a Layer
"Layer Group" is a Group
"Background" is a Layer
```

## Next tasks (see below)
- Saving

## Currently supports
- Loading xcf files (up to current GIMP version 2.10)
- Getting image hierarchy and info
- Getting image for each layer (PIL image)
- .gbr brushes
- .vbr brushes
- .gpl palette files
- .pat pattern files
- .gtp tool presets
- Generate a flattened image
- Add new layers

## In progress but results in crashes and tests failing
- Saving
- .ggr gradients - reads/saves fine, but I need to come up with a way to get the
actual colours
- .gih brush sets - BUG: seems to have more image data per brush than what's
expected
- .gpb brush - should work, but I need some test files

## Not implemented
- Exported paths in .svg format. - Reading should be easy enough, but I need to
ensure I don't get a full-blown svg in the mix
- Standard "parasites"

## Install With PIP

```python
pip install gimpformats
```

Head to https://pypi.org/project/gimpformats/ for more info

## Language information
### Built for
